//Run it on a Linux System.
//Put it inside: "~/Sockets/TCPServer" directory.

/*
 Here is depicted the workflow for the TCP server:
 
 +---------------+
 |               |
 |   socket()    |  Create a socket through a call to socket()
 |               |
 +---------------+
         |
         |
         v
 +---------------+
 |               |
 |    bind()     |   Bind the socket to an IP and Port through bind()
 |               |
 +---------------+      
         |
         |
         v
 +---------------+
 |               |
 |   listen()    |   The server can listen for connections thanks to listen()
 |               |
 +---------------+
         |
         |
         v
 +---------------+
 |               |
 |    accept()   |   The server can accept the connection through accept()...  
 |               |   
 +---------------+
          |
         |
         v
 +---------------+
 |               |
 | send()/recv() |  ... and then send() or recv() data to the other socket he's connected to
 |               |   
 +---------------+
