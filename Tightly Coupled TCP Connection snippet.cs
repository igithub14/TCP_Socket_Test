/*
  This snippet depicts how a Client can invoke a remote function via a TCP conneciton.
  This procedure is only reasonable on a tightly coupled system.
  The scenario is that of a front-end web client invoking a remote function on a back-end system.
  Eg: Bank system. The client invokes the remote function to make a fund transfer.
