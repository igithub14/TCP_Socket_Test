# TCP_Socket_Test
This bunch of files are for testing a TCP connection between two tightly coupled homogeneous systems. Later, I'm gonna test a more loosely coupled solution. 

The main goal is to make it possibile the communication between two heterogeneous systems.

In order to make the solution more loosely coupled I must remove all the dependencies one by one.

Referring to the file *Tightly Coupled TCP Connection snippet.cs*, I must consider the following dependencies:

  • Platform Technology: internal representations of numbers and objects
  • Location: hard-coded machine addresses
  • Time: all components have to be available at the same time  
  • Data Format: the list of parameters and their types must match 
  
Then:
  • I can use a data format that is self-describing and platform independent, such as XML
  • instead of sending information directly to a specific machine we should send it to an addressable 'channel'
  • enhance the channel to Queue up sent requests until the network and the receiving system are ready (IMPORTANT). 
    That is why we need to wrap data inside Messages.
  •  we also need some way to make data format transformations inside the channel, using transformers
