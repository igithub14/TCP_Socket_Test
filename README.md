# TCP_Socket_Test
This bunch of files are for testing a TCP connection between two tightly coupled homogeneous systems. Later, I'm gonna test a more loosely coupled solution. 

The main goal is to make it possibile the communication between two heterogeneous systems.

In order to make the solution more loosely coupled I must remove all the dependencies one by one.
